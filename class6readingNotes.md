# Class 6 reading notes

An object can be any item (or person) tat has any given amount of characteristics that are also stated or noted. Those specifics characteristics are given a value ('detailed descr.') for ex. A cup is an object, this cups *color* is *blue* and the *shape* is *round* (ive never seen a square cup) however in that example we noted the cups "properties" as *blue* and *round*. That was our object and its properties.

Creating an object literals are easy and clean way of saving/storing data, instead of sending several different variables that are tied a certain topic or person we can create an object literal that emcompasis that those items  and their properties that define said object. this is a much easier and cleaner way to see and send info.

an Object is a great way to send a specific structured set of related data which one or more those bits of data can be an array which allow it to even be exapanded upon even further into another set of specific structure (which could also be an array of that specific member.)

The term "this" is referring to the specific object that the property belongs too, using this his very helpful to keep code clean, readable and organized. This allows an easier way to reffer to a certain properties key and value... this is helpful because its possible the value is an array stored in a value.

## DOM

A DOM is a Document object model, This is an interface that displays the document as "nods" these nodes are representitive of elements and attributes (in the HTML document). having this info allows one to "focus"on a certain node and make edits to them by way of JS. The data (tree) represents the actual objects that comprise the *structure* & *content*  of a doc. In this doc all properties, methods and events are organized into objects.

The Dom is not apart of JS however JS uses the DOM to access to the elements in the document that allows for a dynamic experience.

When the document loads it creates a model of ther page in the memory of the broswer.The Dom is comprised of various "nodes" like

- doc node (this sits at the top of the tree).

- element nodes.

- attribute nodes.

- text nodes.

the nodes can be navigated inorder to be "granted" access to change said parts of the elements, they have a certain hierarchy (grandparent,parent,child,sibling).
