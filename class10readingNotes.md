# Debugging

- syntaxt error: most of these errors are spelling errors that cause the program to not run or these errors will even cause the program to stop running part way through.

- Logic : Here the syntax is usually correct however the code doesnt do what it was intended to do.

These two are the most common types of errors.

here is a few simples ways to check for errors:

- CHECK THE CONSOLE!
- read the ``x`` that shows the error.
This usually shows what type of error, you can learn more about the links that often send to MDN.

The name of the JS file links to debugger tab of dev tool IF link is followed youll see where the error is highlighted.

    the line number is where the error is. (often its misspelling)  partially because JS is case sensitive.

- ``null`` means "nothing".

## Logic errors

"console.log" is gonna be your best friend to isolate the problem.

- "syntax missing ';' before error" statement usually means ';' is missing. (always check assigment operator).

- "syntax error missing () is the missing of the paren.

- "syntax error missing : after property" usually means there is an incorrectly formed statement.

- syntax error : expected expression got 'string' or syntax unterminated string literal. Usually means you left off a  string value's open or close quote. These were found instead of quote marks at the beginning of the string.
